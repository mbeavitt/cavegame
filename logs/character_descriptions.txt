Can you improve this plot for my game?

In the far distant future, after the events of the Great Flare, a small village of scavengers and tinkers live together in relative peace, deep in the mountain hardwood forests. Their simple lives farming and hunting come to an abrupt halt when a traveller arrives from the desert plains. The wise elder recognises the traveller from a dream, but the townsfolk are suspicious.

One morning, they find the son of the mayor dead in the town square – it looks like the work of dark magic. Turning on the traveller, he/she finds themselves running for their life into the dark forest. Finding refuge in a deep cave, the Traveller falls deep into a dark pit, knocking themselves unconscious. The elder appears in front of them, as an apparition. They are told that a dark spirit has infiltrated the village, and plans to take over the minds of the villagers living there, making them minions. What evil plans are on the horizon could be anyone’s guess…

They wake up with strange new magical possessions.

The Traveller must gather their wits and find a way out of the cave, and figure out how to get the town back to normal.

Can you improve upon and extend this description of the main character?

More suited to desert life, they are dressed in loose fitting breathable clothing. They're young, perhaps just old enough to start exploring the world on their own. They might have mystical tattoos or runes on their skin/face, which may come into play later in the game as magical conduits or similar. It could be cool to have them masked, as flora suggested. I think that would give the game a unique style. The Traveller is a survivalist, suited to the outdoors. Perhaps they have a familiar, like a small animal companion? They have a backpack and lots of pouches and pockets to keep their many items in.
