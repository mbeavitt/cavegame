# cavegame
A 2d platformer game project


In the far distant future, after the events of the Great Flare, a small village of scavengers and tinkers live together in relative peace, deep in the mountain hardwood forests. Their simple lives farming and hunting come to an abrupt halt when a traveller arrives from the desert plains. The wise elder recognises the traveller from a dream, but the townsfolk are suspicious.

One morning, they find the son of the mayor dead in the town square – it looks like the work of dark magic. Turning on the traveller, he/she finds themselves running for their life into the dark forest. Finding refuge in a deep cave, the Traveller falls deep into a dark pit, knocking themselves unconscious. The elder appears in front of them, as an apparition. They are told that a dark spirit has infiltrated the village, and plans to take over the minds of the villagers living there, making them minions. What evil plans are on the horizon could be anyone’s guess…

They wake up with strange new magical possessions.

The Traveller must gather their wits and find a way out of the cave, and figure out how to get the town back to normal.

Evil spirit (antagonist - what do they look like?)

To start with, we’ll create the first chapter - escaping the cave. Perhaps we need to find weapons/armour, and solve some puzzles? Could there be an interesting puzzle mechanic? The cave level would ideally be a dark and spooky platformer style – maybe we can do something interesting with light and being able to see specific parts of the level to progress..?


# Character descriptions:

The Traveller (Protagonist):
More suited to desert life, they are dressed in loose fitting breathable clothing. They're young, perhaps just old enough to start exploring the world on their own. They might have mystical tattoos or runes on their skin/face, which may come into play later in the game as magical conduits or similar. It could be cool to have them masked, as flora suggested. I think that would give the game a unique style. The Traveller is a survivalist, suited to the outdoors. Perhaps they have a familiar, like a small animal companion? They have a backpack and lots of pouches and pockets to keep their many items in.

The Mayor:
World weary and pushed into a position of power by necessity, the mayor is rough at the edges and has seen it all. His eyes are deep set, haunting, telling tales of cold winters and hard decisions. He's pulled his people through great hardships through pure grit, having to sacrifice everything to survive. Finally, it seems like everything is on track, until the worst possible thing happens...

The Mayor's son:
Young and overconfident, he doesn't understand what the generation before him has had to go through in order for his life to be so easy. He's arrogant and self-assured.

The Evil:
I'm really not sure yet what the evil antagonist in the game should look like yet. Maybe some reference to the technology wipeout that is implied by the "great flare" event...? Some kind of rogue AI that has survived the wipeout and taken human form...?


# Art style and overall design:

The game will follow a simple pixel design, hopefully with some interesting shading from light sources to make things look interesting. What's needed in terms of art is a detailed character profile for each character, to use in cutscenes and interactions, as well as side-profile pixelated sprites for enemies and the protagonist.
