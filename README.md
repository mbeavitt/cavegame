# cavegame
A 2d platformer game project


In the far distant future, after the events of the Great Flare, a small village of scavengers and tinkers live together in relative peace, deep in the mountain hardwood forests. Their simple lives farming and hunting come to an abrupt halt when a traveller arrives from the desert plains. The wise elder recognises the traveller from a dream, but the townsfolk are suspicious.

One morning, they find the son of the mayor dead in the town square – it looks like the work of dark magic. Turning on the traveller, he/she finds themselves running for their life into the dark forest. Finding refuge in a deep cave, the Traveller falls deep into a dark pit, knocking themselves unconscious. The elder appears in front of them, as an apparition. They are told that a dark spirit has infiltrated the village, and plans to take over the minds of the villagers living there, making them minions. What evil plans are on the horizon could be anyone’s guess…

They wake up with strange new magical possessions.

The Traveller must gather their wits and find a way out of the cave, and figure out how to get the town back to normal.

To start with, we’ll create the first chapter - escaping the cave. Perhaps we need to find weapons/armour, and solve some puzzles? Could there be an interesting puzzle mechanic? The cave level would ideally be a dark and spooky platformer style – maybe we can do something interesting with light and being able to see specific parts of the level to progress..?
