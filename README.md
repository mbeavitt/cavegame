# cavegame
A 2d platformer game project


In the far distant future, after the devastating Great Flare, a small village of scavengers and tinkers have managed to carve out a simple but peaceful life for themselves in the mountain hardwood forests. However, their tranquility is shattered when a mysterious traveler arrives from the desert plains. The wise elder recognizes the traveler from a dream, but the other townsfolk are immediately suspicious of the newcomer.

One morning, the son of the mayor is found dead in the town square, and it appears that dark magic was involved in the murder. The traveler becomes the prime suspect, and they are forced to flee into the dark forest to escape the wrath of the villagers. As they flee, they stumble upon a deep cave and fall into a pit, knocking themselves unconscious.

When they wake up, they find themselves in the presence of an apparition of the elder, who reveals that a malevolent spirit has infiltrated the village and plans to take control of the villagers' minds, turning them into minions. The traveler is given strange new magical powers and tasked with finding a way out of the cave, and finding a way to rid the town of the dark spirit's influence and restore it to its peaceful state.

To start with, we’ll create the first chapter - escaping the cave. Perhaps we need to find weapons/armour, and solve some puzzles? Could there be an interesting puzzle mechanic? The cave level would ideally be a dark and spooky platformer style – maybe we can do something interesting with light and being able to see specific parts of the level to progress..?


# Character descriptions:

The Traveller (Protagonist):
More suited to desert life, they are dressed in loose fitting breathable clothing. They're young, perhaps just old enough to start exploring the world on their own. They might have mystical tattoos or runes on their skin/face, which may come into play later in the game as magical conduits or similar. It could be cool to have them masked, as flora suggested. I think that would give the game a unique style. The Traveller is a survivalist, suited to the outdoors. Perhaps they have a familiar, like a small animal companion? They have a backpack and lots of pouches and pockets to keep their many items in.

The Mayor:
World weary and pushed into a position of power by necessity, the mayor is rough at the edges and has seen it all. His eyes are deep set, haunting, telling tales of cold winters and hard decisions. He is a strong-willed and ambitious leader who is deeply devoted to the safety and well-being of the village. He is torn between his loyalty to his son and his duty to the community when the traveler becomes the suspect in their son's death. He's pulled his people through great hardships through pure grit, having to sacrifice everything to survive. Finally, it seems like everything is on track, until the worst possible thing happens...

The Mayor's son:
Young and overconfident, he doesn't understand what the generation before him has had to go through in order for his life to be so easy. He's arrogant and self-assured.

The Evil Spirit:
I'm really not sure yet what the evil antagonist in the game should look like yet. Maybe some reference to the technology wipeout that is implied by the "great flare" event...? Some kind of rogue AI that has survived the wipeout and taken human form...?

The Tinkers: The tinkers are a group of skilled craftsmen and inventors who live in the village and are known for their resourcefulness and ability to repair and create all sorts of gadgets and tools. They may be able to help the traveler in their quest to defeat the malevolent spirit.

The Scavengers: The scavengers are a group of scrappy and resourceful individuals who make a living by scouring the land for valuable resources and relics. They may be able to provide valuable information or assistance to the traveler as they navigate the dangers of the forest and cave.

# Art style and overall design:

The game will follow a simple pixel design, hopefully with some interesting shading from light sources to make things look interesting. What's needed in terms of art is a detailed character profile for each character, to use in cutscenes and interactions, as well as side-profile pixelated sprites for enemies and the protagonist.
